3-Storey Office Network Project Completed!

We are proud to announce the completion of a comprehensive network project for a 3-storey office, focusing on improving the stability, security, and efficiency of the network as a whole. 

In this project, we have conducted network topology evaluation and improvement, including:

Better separation of wireless networks. 
Implementation of a failover system for internet connections, ensuring uninterrupted connectivity. 
Implementation of Access Control List (ACL) for tighter traffic access control. 
The main goal is to address connection interruptions, low security issues, lack of network segmentation, and the absence of internet backup mechanisms in the previous network.
